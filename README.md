# Classification of Agricultural Seeds Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms

This study employs several machine learning algorithms to classify agricultural seeds, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressor. The performance of these methods is compared based on several metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision and Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (RÂ²) Score**

The assignment involves preprocessing the data, visualizing it, and developing predictive models to classify agricultural seeds accurately. The goal is to determine the most effective model for this classification task, ensuring reliable and accurate predictions.

The repository includes the dataset, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts for preprocessing.
