# Agricultural Seed Classification
**Classification of Agricultural Seeds Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms**
This study employs several machine learning algorithms to classify agricultural seeds, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressor. The performance of these methods is compared based on several metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision and Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (RÂ²) Score**
